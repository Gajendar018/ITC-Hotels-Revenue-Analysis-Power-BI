# 🏨 ITC Hotels Revenue Analytics Dashboard  
### 📊 Power BI • Data Modeling • DAX • Hospitality Analytics  

This project delivers a complete 4-page interactive Power BI dashboard for **ITC Hotels**, focused on optimizing revenue, improving occupancy, understanding room category performance, and reducing financial loss from cancellations.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective  
To design a data-driven Revenue Intelligence System that gives management a unified, dynamic, and actionable view of:

- Financial performance  
- Occupancy & capacity utilization  
- Room category profitability  
- Cancellation trends & lost revenue  

This project converts raw booking data into **KPIs, insights, and visual analytics** using Power BI, Power Query, and advanced DAX.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI (Visualizations & Dashboard Development)**  
- **Power Query (ETL & Data Cleaning)**  
- **DAX (KPI Calculations & Time Intelligence)**  
- **Star Schema Data Modeling**

### 1️⃣ Financial Overview  
- Total Revenue: **1.71 Billion**  
- Average Daily Rate (ADR): **14.92k**  
- Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): **7.35k**  
- MoM & WoW Growth  
- Revenue concentration by room category  

### 2️⃣ Occupancy & Capacity  
- Occupancy Rate: **43.5%**  
- Capacity utilization  
- Weekend vs Weekday performance  
- Occupancy heatmap to identify low-performing properties  

### 3️⃣ Room Category Performance  
- Average Length of Stay (ALOS): ~2.37 days  
- Booking Lead Time: ~3.71 days  
- Revenue contribution by room class  
- Booking behavior analysis  

### 4️⃣ Cancellations & Lost Revenue  
- Cancellation Rate: **24.83%**  
- Total Lost Revenue

## 📐 Data Model (Star Schema)
- **Fact Table:** Booking Transactions  
- **Dimension Tables:** Date, Room, Property  
- **Occupancy Table:** Used for RevPAR and accurate capacity modeling  
- Hierarchies: Year → Quarter → Month for time intelligence  

---

## 📈 Key DAX Measures  
- Total Revenue  
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)  
- RevPAR  
- Occupancy %  
- Cancellation Rate  
- MoM/WoW Growth %  
- Cumulative Revenue  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- High ADR but low RevPAR → Occupancy improvement required  
- Luxury/Premium rooms generate highest revenue  
- Weekday vs Weekend patterns reveal hotel behavior type  
- 25% cancellation rate → major revenue leakage  
- Specific room categories and months show high cancellation risk  

---

- Track financial leakage due to cancellations  
- Improve pricing strategies  
- Identify underperforming room/property combinations  
- Understand booking behavior  
- Support strategic revenue management decisions
